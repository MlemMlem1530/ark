*********************************************
Ark Core implemented in Python
*********************************************

Work in Progress.

If you're new here, and don't know what this is about, `read this`_.


This project will be getting better and better as the time goes on, but please be
patient if something is weird for the time being :)

If you have any questions/suggestions or whatever, find me on Ark Slack @tsifrer.


If you're looking at the code and commits, you might find weird code, messages,
text and other stuff, as this is how I develop and remember things. In the end,
all will be nice and pretty, but untill the basic structure of the project is not
100% complete, whole repo will be a mess.
