Ark Core implemented in Python
*********************************************

Work in Progress.

If you're looking at the code and commits, you might find weird code, messages,
text and other stuff, as this is how I develop and remember things. In the end,
all will be nice and pretty, but untill the basic structure of the project is not
100% complete, whole repo will be a mess.
